			<p>SolydXK comes with a wide variety of drivers pre-installed. For most
purposes these drivers suffice but in some cases better performance is
provided by the proprietary drivers of the manufacturer.</p>
			<p>The install button will open the SolydXK System Settings application. This
is a tool to help you installing these hardware drivers. It will check your
hardware and list any available proprietary drivers you can install. You
only need to select the recommended driver for your hardware and the
application will do the rest.</p>
			<p>Currently <strong>Nvidia</strong>, <strong>AMD/ATI</strong> and
<strong>Broadcom</strong> drivers can be installed. SolydXK System Settings
also allows to install the <strong>PAE</strong> kernel for multi-core 32-bit
systems.</p>
